# ATM-MANAGEMENT-PROJECT
BASIC JAVA PROJECT

This program simulates an ATM with the options to check balance, withdraw money, deposit money, and exit. The balance is initially set to 10,000, and any changes made to the balance are stored in the balance variable. The checkBalance, withdrawMoney, and depositMoney methods handle the corresponding operations, while the main method handles user input and invokes the appropriate method based on the user's choice.
